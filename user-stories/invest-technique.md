# Invest Technique

## Independent

- Make stories as independent of each other as possible
- Find a natural order to do the stories

## Negotiable

- **Why** and **What** and not the **How**

## Valuable

- The bottom line is to provide value for the end user
  - decrease pain
  - increase joy (save time, improve UX)

## Estimable

- Relatively, and **not** absolutely (in hours)
- Key factors:
  - Incorrect or incomplete description
  - Technical experience or lack there of
  - Predictability of dependencies

## Sized

Stories need to be granular enough to fit into a single sprint

## Testable

- **What** to test (well defined properties)
- **How** to test
- Automate early
